Scripts for ArcGIS 10.x in Python 2.7


### Abruf3.py

*Date: 2011*

Uses arcpy to extract values of several rasters at specified coordinates and write them
to a file.

Similar to https://github.com/jdegene/Various-Python-2.x/blob/master/Abruf2.py however
Abruf3.py does not calculate any mean values
